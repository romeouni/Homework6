## 1.
```{python}
#| eval: false

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            fib.append(fib[i-1] + fib[i-2])
        return fib
```

Results of using /explain on this code snippet:

The provided code defines a function named fibonacci that generates a list containing the Fibonacci sequence up to the n-th term. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

The function begins by checking if the input n is less than or equal to 0. If this condition is met, it returns an empty list, as there are no terms to generate. If n is equal to 1, the function returns a list containing only the first term of the Fibonacci sequence, which is [0]. Similarly, if n is equal to 2, it returns the first two terms of the sequence, [0, 1].

For values of n greater than 2, the function initializes a list fib with the first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence, [0, 1]. It then enters a loop that runs from 2 to n-1. In each iteration of the loop, the function calculates the next term in the sequence by summing the two most recent terms (fib[i-1] and fib[i-2]) and appends this new term to the fib list. After the loop completes, the function returns the list fib, which now contains the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
